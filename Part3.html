		<div>600</div>
		<div>Rain nearly all day and sea fairly rough. Fine in the afternoon & did a little washing. We hope to reach a port tomorrow. This will make 9 weeks all but one day, and we all won’t be sorry the voyage is over. 

Last night we sighted what turned out to be a balloon attached to a destroyer & later on we could discern two destroyers & then two or 
three more. Today we have 6 or 7 in charge of us and also the balloon. Life belts are worn all the time now. 

There were another two deaths last night. The band has now disbanded & all the goods have been handed in and will be sent back to New Zealand. We were all issued with a field [dressing] pocket today and has to be sewn on the inside of our tunics.
</div>
		<div>Fine again with a shower or two and a stiff breeze blowing. Much cooler now and sea a bit choppy this morning. 

More deaths and burials, total now 42. A crying shame but it is only to be expected when human beings are herded together the way they have been on this boat. We have not had a fair deal at all. One of the Officers, one of the crew and one
of ship’s engineers are included in today’s list of dead. 
Am mess orderly again today. We are all hungering for the sight of land and are all heartily sick of the sea. Where ever any one goes, the same old topic is spoken, “When we get on shore again”. Oh well a few more days will do it now if we don’t get torpedoed.
</div>
		<div>Warm and calm again and sea smooth. The cruiser at times leaves us for a look round on her own and then joins up again at night when she usually has a fair amount of signaling to do.

Still more parading sick and about 900 must be down with it now. All decks are covered with sick men and also B company’s quarters were used for a lot of men but only for one night, next day they were all moved upstairs to the boat deck which is covered in all around now with canvas. 

Dysentery and diarrhoea seem to have got a hold of some also. We have had no deaths yet I am glad to say but there has been quite a number of burials on the other boats which has yellow fever on board. About the same myself and have eaten nothing hardly.

		<div>Part
III</div>
		<div>According to New Zealand historian Ryan McClane, only 260 of the 1, 117 troops onboard the Tahiti were fit for deployment six weeks after the troopships arrival in Plymouth. None of them would see combat, as WW1 ended shortly after their recovery on November 11, 1918. Seven percent of all those who departed onboard the Tahiti died from the influenza outbreak. 

The second wave of the 1918 pandemic would go on to claim millions of lives. The CDC estimates in total that one-third of the world's population at the time was infected with the virus, with at least 50 million deaths world-wide.

Marcus Hansen survived his bout with the virus and married his fiancée Vera Halfyard upon his return on December 29, 1918. The Hansens would have three children. Marcus resumed his employment in the postal service in New Zealand, where he remained until his death in 1963.

		<div>Weather very cloudy and windy, sea very rough and some very big waves at times. We have to travel at very slow rate on account of one convoy not being able to keep up with the rest. 

One burial today. Orders now to wear our life belts continuously. Owing to the disease on board we have been advised to destroy any letters we have written so as not to spread the disease. 

Heard today that the Sergeant’s mess have received from the skipper a certificate asking them to sign to the effect that the food and general comfort on this ship was all that could be desired and not one would sign it. This speaks for itself in face of all the deaths on board from sickness and lack of medicine, and general comfort, why the only place we can sit on deck is the floor and that is often wet.
</div>
		<div>19
</div>
		<div>Fine day and sea like glass. Quite a gloom was cast round the cabin as soon as we were up when three deaths were reported on board. The burials took place at 11am and there were 4 burials. The Colonel read the service and it was quite a touching scene.

This afternoon two more burials took place and there is another death. The other ships are also busy with burials. One of the deaths is our Clarionette player in the band and a beautiful player he was too. 

The strange thing about this sickness is that the big strong men seem to get it the worst and are the ones that die. One of the deaths is namesake of myself I hear. 

Today was mess orderly again. Was also able to eat a bit today and feel much better.
</div>
		<div>WAIKATO, New Zealand — High up on the south side of the entrance to the Waikato River, an old soda bottle was found partly buried in the sand. The glass was weathered nearly smooth and the cork had started to decay, but the contents had managed to withstand the test of time. 

In addition to a small quantity of black sand, the bottle contained a page from a small, loose-leaf notebook and a telegram envelope dated July 10, 1918 — the day the Tahiti departed Wellington 18 years prior. One side of the page contained the following message, as published in the local newspaper:
</div>
		<div>Sunday, September 8</div>
		<div>Monday, September 2</div>
		<div>Entry #60</div>
		<div>Entry #54</div>
		<div>Weather very hot and sea like glass and a lot more on sick parade, dozens of them in fact. The sickness is going round the ship very rapidly and every available bit of floor space is being converted into a hospital. Am still about the same myself and temperature is 102.2. All temperatures are being taken and any above 104 go into the hospital. 

I have not felt the need of parading sick yet and don’t think I will if I can help it as it is not much catch sleeping on the hard deck and I can get about all right but it makes one as weak as a kitten and it is great to see big strong men just bowled over and hardly able to walk, it is quite pitiful. 

Band practices are just now knocked in the head as some of the members are not well enough and cannot muster enough.

</div>
		<div>Wednesday, August 28</div>
		<div>21
</div>
		<div>Entry #49</div>
		<div>Fine day smooth sea & a slight breeze. Sickness still prevalent and 4 more burials today. One of the Specs, Kemp by name, was one of the unfortunate in today’s lot. 
The position of our ship today is changed, we are on the extreme right and consequently have to do submarine guard duty. 

Feeling just about well now and would relish a decent meal but I dare say it will be a long while before any decent meals are seen again, they won’t be seen in the army I am certain of that.
I am mess orderly again today and dare say will be until I get to England. I don’t think the band will have much more to do on the voyage. 

Rain appears to be coming up this evening and 
if so it will not be too good for the invalids on 
the deck.

		<div>Private Charles Davidson delivered a vivid recollection of the outbreak, as published in historian Geoffrey Rice's book, “Black November: The 1918 Influenza Pandemic in New Zealand."

Pvt. Davidson on the deaths aboard the ship:

“When word went around that deaths had occurred, the effect was noticeable. There was no way of escape, nothing to do, nowhere to go, no medicine and little attention. Soldiers just died where they lay on deck… Bodies were wrapped in canvas and weighted with fire bars, then after a short service at dusk each evening, were committed to the deep in a chute forward of the bridge."
</div>
		<div>Pvt. Charles A. Davidson’s account</div>
		<div>Charting the devastation</div>
		<div>A 2010 study of the outbreak on HMNZT Tahiti, titled “Mortality risk factors for pandemic influenza on New Zealand troop ship, 1918,” reports that while exact numbers of total cases cannot be determined, in the official Inquiry Report the military commander estimated a total of 800 cases on the peak day.

With information obtained from the Auckland War Memorial Museum’s Cenotaph database, researchers were then able to approximate daily rates for total cases and deaths. At right is a repurposed version of their chart.

While the infection rate is approximate, it should be noted that the total numbers of deaths from the 2010 study matched a handwritten list of the dead, which was kept by Regimental Sergeant Major Percival Gunn McIntosh. The list was generously provided by his great-niece, Lynne Blake. </div>

		<div>Fine but very cold & sea fair. Land was in sight this morning and all very excited in the thought of getting on land again for good. We were told this morning by the O.C that we were now bound for London. At dinner time instructions were received to turn about and make for Plymouth which we did and arrived there at 3pm. 

It was bitterly cold as the wind was right ahead and we were going at top speed all the way. We alone and the balloon and one destroyer left the other part of the convoy and the cruiser had left before us & was here when we arrived. The country here looks really beautiful green fields & ploughed land with forests here and there. The town here looks very big and a lot of ships of all descriptions for war & otherwise. The people were all cheering as we went past the pier and up the river.
One man died as we were coming in to port. Total now 78 – 73 troops & 5 crew.
</div>
		<div>Fine, strong breeze most of the day and sea choppy. More burials again, total this morning was 59. Our Coy has lost 5. I suppose at the rate we are going we will lose about 100. 

We had a bit more food to eat today and not before it was due either. We came from a country where they grow meat & we are treated as though we are kids and don’t require any. 

The Canteen will close tomorrow so it looks as though we are nearing a port. We expect to meet a couple more escorts tomorrow. 

Was mess orderly again today. There is an awful lot of coughing going on since this sickness has come among us & all night long there is a continual barking in the [cell].
</div>
		<div>Warm and calm and sea smooth. A few are able to move about but still an awful lot down. I was able to give a hand today to move a few off our deck on to another deck while we scrubbed the place down and then shifted them back. 

We have about 50 down for meals but the muck we get to eat does not tempt any one to eat, They get it on their plates look at it, turn it over a few times, taste it and that is the finish of it. There are tons of meat etc wasted just for the want of cooking into a decent dish, but it is the same every time, no-one can cut it and then if you could, it has no taste to it. 

The ship has also run short of medicine now, this sickness must have been something they did not bargain for.

		<div>Fine but very cold and windy, sea very rough & spray coming over at times. 

More burials again, total somewhere about 70 now. Bought a couple of postcards today of this ship taken in rough sea and they are rather
good ones. 

Nearly the whole of the decks are clear of the sick but the halls and passage ways are about covered with them. The coughing of a lot of men still continues and seems to be a lasting complaint. It looks as though nearly the whole of this [reinforcement] will not be fit for much after this set back they have had. 

Am feeling fairly well myself except for a cough now and again. Am mess orderly still. No band practice yet.
</div>
		<div>Fine and warm and sea smooth. 

At 6.30am a man was reported overboard. The ship at once turned around and a boat was got ready lowered. After going back about half a mile he was seen all right, swimming about and after a time was picked up OK. He was one of the invalids and I believe was delirious and jumped in when his guard was away temporarily. It took about 3 hours to catch up to the convoy again. 
Am feeling fairly weak today and am mess orderly but can’t eat the rubbish we get. I make an attempt with the rest but that is about all. Most of the boys are still down and I think will be some weeks before they are well again, if ever. The whole of our strength seems to have gone absolutely & it will take good food and a spell on land before any pick up again.

		<div>Sunday, September 1</div>
		<div>The bottle’s message was a hopeful promise that tragically could not be realized by 78 of those onboard that voyage.
</div>
		<div>One day after departing Freetown, private Hansen notes in his diary that the hospital aboard HMNZT Tahiti was over capacity. Despite the officers’ precautions, the influenza virus has managed to creep its way onboard. And with the crowded quarters, limited amount of medical supplies and poor ventilation, disaster is about to unfold. The Tahiti forges on, leaving behind a trail of death in its wake.
</div>
		<div>AUGUST 26, 1918:</div>
		<div>Dr. D.C. Low on the medical staff aboard the Tahiti:
</div>
		<div>9 additional deaths occurred on land</div>
		<div>Credits & Acknowledgements</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>“July 12, 1918. H.M.N.Z.T. 107. T.S.S. Tahiti, 48 hours out from Wellington, New Zealand, steering due west. Greetings from the 40th Machine-gun Section, N.Z.E.F. Corporal A. W. Brown, 62863, and Private W. F. Brown, 74777. Will be home some day.”
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>IN DECEMBER 1918, a Court of Inquiry was held to review the circumstances around the illness on the Tahiti. It found several factors which may have contributed:
Crowded quarters and poor ventilation:The most severe rates of infection occurred in those sleeping bunks rather than hammocks,Medical provisions: The medical staff were overwhelmed with work. Nurses were praised for their diligence, while the orderlies were criticized for being ill-trained:“Too much praise cannot be allocated to Sister Maxfield and the nurses under her charge, as all worked most assiduously and effectively to cope with the epidemic. It is regretted that the same cannot be said about the medical orderlies, who were apparently ill-trained and did not show any marked capability or zeal."</div>
		<div>*Reported cases are approximate</div>

		<div>Dr. D.C. Low on some of the symptoms of influenza:
</div>
		<div>Part
I</div>
		<div>10</div>
		<div>Entry #55</div>
		<div>20</div>
		<div>END OF THE DEATH SHIP</div>
		<div>Still fine with a fair breeze, sea bit rough. At 6.30am a man jumped overboard, we pulled up but could not find him. Another batch of burials, total to date 26. 

We are supposed to arrive at Plymouth on Monday 9th. I am still mess orderly and won’t be sorry when this journey which is getting very miserable is over. Feel fairly well now but want a good meal or two and a clean one. 

We are still in the same position with the other boats.</div>
		<div>Initially, it was reported that nothing was known of what became of the bottle’s original senders. But soon afterwards, one of them, Corporal A.W. Brown, was located in Christchurch, New Zealand. 

Brown recalled the journey as ill-fated from the start. When marching to board the ship in Wellington, the parade passed a funeral — which was seen as a bad omen by some of the men. The 40th’s misfortune continued when they encountered the terrible storm shortly after departing from Wellington.

The influenza outbreak would ultimately earn HMNZT Tahiti its title as “The Death Ship.” However the tragedy was quickly overshadowed by the widespread devastation caused by the 1918 pandemic. In the words of Dr. D.C. Low, “it was forgotten.”

But today — in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic — and with the aid of a soldier’s diary, a half-century old radio interview, and a message in a bottle the story of the “The Death Ship” and the 40th reinforcements can continue to live on.


</div>
		<div>A slight breeze and sea a bit choppy. Much cooler and fresher which is greatly needed on this stinking tub. Two or three hundred more on sick parade today and the nurses and doctors have their hands full all right now. 

I believe two nurses, the skipper and some of the officers, four or five engineers and 11 firemen are down with this rotten malady now & I heard also there are about 700 down all told, quite a catastrophe all right but only to be expected when men are packed in such a small space and have to eat and sleep and live there and then going through the tropics and anchoring 4 days in a fever stricken port.
 
The cause of the sickness which may be an African fever of some sort may be due to the water we took in at Capetown. Three more ships in our fleet today.
</div>
		<div>Tuesday, August 27</div>
		<div>30</div>
		<div>Wednesday, September 4</div>
		<div>Fairly warm and showers of rain occasionally.

An epidemic of influenza seems to have broken out on board. Sixty odd on this morning’s sick parade and 24 admissions to the hospital. Have caught it myself of course but so far am able to get about & think I will hang out all right but feel very crook. 

Saw a few porpoises quite near the boat today. We are still travelling in the same formation but the distances from each boat varies. 

No band this morning, as a lot of the members are not well. This afternoon we pasted some music on to cards instead of practicing. This morning we had a lecture for half an hour on transport etc in England and was a most idiotic lecture too. Had no object in it that I could see.
