		<div>Sunday, July 14</div>
		<div>Three times we had to do this and then we were at liberty till 4pm. We all made good use of the restaurants & ham and eggs had a good demand. At the P.O. I became acquainted with an employee who very kindly showed me around the office, was introduced to the PM there who has been in this office since he was 14 and is now 57. Rather a good record. This town is a very nice place & has some very picturesque houses and buildings. The harbour is very big also.

		<div>We were anchored in the port of Albany and stores and coal were taken in. The weather was fine and we were all to go ashore for a route march. As we were anchored away from the wharf a launch was chartered to take us ashore. Three trips were required and £15 was the fee charged & at the expense of the men too. 
No leave was given but a number were told off to get any articles required by the men. The band went ashore in the first trip and marched up to the town and waited for each company and then played them from the P.O. to the Town Hall. </div>

		<div>Entry #13</div>
		<div>Yes, well, this started just after we left Freetown. In all, I should think we must have had more than 1,000 cases of influenza on this ship, out of troops in complement probably of about 1,500. 

</div>
		<div>Embarked on the S.S. “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10 a.m. We left the wharf at 1:55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well.
There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1,200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7,000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ’tween decks. </div>

</div>
		<div>There were questions asked in Parliament about sickness on this ship. Why? Were the medical officers efficient? Were the stores sufficient? Were there sufficient drugs onboard?
</div>
		<div>Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather. 
The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.</div>

		<div>"Letter writing"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummny nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore</div>
		<div>The next few days saw much calmer seas. 
Life aboard Tahiti began to fall into routine, with a few challenges along the way. Washing and shaving proved especially difficult due to the constant swells of the ship. 
Anticipation among the troops began to build for their first stop — Albany, Western Australia.
</div>
		<div>Our bunks, when we crawl into them, we look like caterpillars and as mine is right over a right of way to the stairs, the privacy of my bedroom is conspicuous by its absence. Water would run down & trickle in to my bed so got Bill C to move his one peg & so enabled me to move mine to a good position & am now ok.

</div>
		<div>Coaling was essential to a troopship’s speed and endurance. Commanders would take every opportunity to ensure their coal bunkers remained full, with refueling being one of the primary reasons for stopping at a port. 

Coaling was a dirty, backbreaking process, and would take the crew hours to complete, often having to labor through the night to deliver the multiple tons of coal required onboard.

Despite being the source of life for the Tahiti, the process of coaling would be among the reasons that led to the death of many onboard the ship in a few weeks’ time.

</div>
		<div>Reveille as usual and weather windy & seas as rough, or rougher than ever. Everyone down in the dumps & some still sick. 

Today, we were all given a pad, envelopes and pencil, so this afternoon everyone is busy writing letters. I wrote two & found it extremely difficult to write owing to the pitching & tossing of the ship. 

At times the waves would dash right over the bows of the ship & a lot of water would run down in to our den where we are living like rats.
</div>
		<div>Few firsthand accounts of the influenza outbreak on the New Zealand troopship Tahiti have surfaced since its ill-fated voyage in the summer of 1918. 

In 1967, a compilation of interviews with New Zealand survivors of the 1918 Spanish Flu were used by broadcaster Jim Henderson in a radio documentary titled “The Great Plague.”

Among those interviewed was Lieutenant D.C. Low, one of the medical officers onboard the Tahiti at the time of the outbreak almost 50 years prior.
</div>
		<div>In 2012, a soldier’s diary was located and transcribed by his grandson, who had discovered it while going through some of his 
late father’s possessions. 

The author of the diary, private Marcus Christian Hansen (now deceased), was a member of the 40th Reinforcements, the New Zealand military unit onboard the troopship from July 10 through September 10, 1918. He was 31 years old at the time of the voyage.
</div>
		<div>Hansen had been working as a telegraphist in New Zealand at the Eketahuna Post Office when he was called for service with the 40th Reinforcements. His experience in postal work is what likely drew him to visit the Albany Post Office.

</div>
		<div>time by the O.C that such was not going to be granted owing to so many desertions on previous drafts. All are greatly disappointed and after tea were all sitting about and consoling with each other. A route march round the town will probably eventuate instead. 

This afternoon the band played a new selection on the boat deck. As the men were a bit excited on arriving in port the authorities got panic stricken & called a parade to keep order.

</div>
		<div>Hansen’s diary provides an unprecedented firsthand account of one the most devastating outbreaks of the 1918 influenza pandemic — an outbreak so severe that the Tahiti became known as the “death ship.”
 
In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Hansen’s family generously allowed his diary transcription to be shared publicly. The voyage of the 40th Reinforcements is what follows, beginning with his first entry on July 10, 1918 in Wellington, New Zealand.
</div>
		<div>Last night was fairly rough. This morning turned out fine and a calm sea. 

Had a church service, band supplied the music. Land sighted at last and everyone greatly excited, at about 11 a.m. Albany reached at 3 p.m. The town from first appearances appears to be about as big as [Masterton]. And the country about looks very bleak although picturesque and in places where broken, looks white like chalk.

We were all in hopes of getting out on leave for a few hours here tomorrow but were informed at tea

		<div>A crowded ship</div>
		<div>End of Part I</div>
		<div>A sports meeting was held today on deck. We had boat drill today also at 4.30 p.m and were instructed what to do and what our boat is in case of wreck. We had to stand quite still and silent for about 10 minutes and it gave one time to ponder when we were told that 10 men from the left will get in the boat & the rest of our platoon will jump into the sea to be picked up by them. Room for 40 and we are 38.
</div>
		<div>Weather fine this morning and sea calm with very slight swell. Quite a treat after the wet and rough sailing we seem to have had so much of.

A whale was sighted about half a mile away today. 
Band practice as usual today and we went through a waltz “Il Bacio” which we played at times in Jupp's band and it brought back to mind old times which seem so far away.
</div>
		<div>Troopship magazines
The typical journey on a troopship from New Zealand to the Western Front took between six to 10 weeks. Lackluster days accumulated into long, monotonous weeks.
To help soldiers cope with the boredom, magazines were produced and printed either onboard or at port for entertainment, with self-submitted observations, reflections, poetry, jokes and ship gossip. 
These magazines were not published until several weeks into the trip to allow for submissions to be collected and edited.Today the publications provide an invaluable perspective into daily life on a troopship.</div>
		<div>Entry #22</div>
		<div>Entry #4</div>
		<div>Now, during that voyage, Dr. Low, when you were assistant medical officer, you had an outbreak of influenza, a quite serious one. 
I wonder if you'd tell me the story?

</div>
		<div>A soldier’s account of his first day at sea onboard the Tahiti was published in HMNZT 107’s official magazine, The Fag End.</div>

</div>
		<div>I often think the skipper & his officers must have very trying time in this rough weather & yet they say it is nothing & that it is only rough when the waves are crashing over the bridge. We have managed a roll call twice a day so far.
</div>
		<div>As rough as ever and cold and waves mountain high. I had often heard the expression about waves being mountains high and can now say I have felt what they are like. 

When we struck these waves sideways on we would have our hammocks almost touch the roof and things would fall off the shelves with a crash & the seats would slide across the floor & the boat would shake & shiver and make one think the end is not far off. But we would find we are still afloat by the morning.

</div>
		<div>Located on the northern shore of Princess Royal Harbour, the port town of Albany is both the southernmost and the oldest British colonial settlement in Western Australia.

In November of 1914, the town saw the first detachment of the Australian Imperial and New Zealand Expeditionary forces depart for WWI, marking the start of Albany's importance as a port of call for New Zealand troopships in the years to come.

		<div>This morning we had some physical drill & a lecture on Discipline. The O.C. congratulated the Spec Coy on not having any orderly room cases after the visit to Albany. 

This afternoon we had a band practice on the gun deck and from now onward we are to practice morning and afternoon which am rather pleased at as the time passes much more agreeably and it is good practice also.

</div>
		<div>Tuesday, July 23</div>
		<div>Lieutenant D. C. Low, who was assistant medical officer onboard the New Zealand transporter, Tahiti.
Tahiti left Wellington on the tenth of July, 1918.
</div>
		<div>The first few days at sea brought regular bouts of seasickness among those unexperienced with the erratic swells of a ship on water. This would continue to recur for many soldiers upon leaving each port of call on Tahiti's journey.
</div>
		<div>Last night we left Albany at a little after midnight and we got some more pitching and rolling about and we awoke in the morning with the feeling the same as we felt when arriving back at camp after a weekend holiday. Feeling rather miserable. 

A few men were overdue in coming back to the boat for Perth but I believe have been caught. One poor chap was taken ashore here from the ship hospital suffering from pneumonia. 

</div>
		<div>At the WN port Dick Hamilton introduced me to Mr. Wicks O.C pantry & gave me & a cobber the option of taking on a job there in our spare time & have the privilege of dining there on saloon fare. Offer accepted but not yet availed of. About 20 of us got a [dunking] on the middle deck with a big wave.</div>
		<div>Navy parade through Stirling TerraceThe clock tower of the Albany Post Office is visible behind the troops. Courtesy of the State Library of Western Australia.</div>
		<div>Built in Scotland in 1904 as the RMS Port Kingston, the 7.6-ton, two-masted screw steamer was subsequently purchased in 1911 by the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand and rechristened the SS Tahiti. 
The vessel then served as a passenger and cargo ship until it was called for service on the outbreak of WWI in 1914. SS Tahiti was then designated HMNZT (His Majesty’s New Zealand Troopship) Tahiti and joined a fleet of troopships to transport New Zealand Expeditionary Forces to and from the Western Front throughout the war.
</div>
		<div>Hansen’s position in the band landed him and his fellow musicians the fortune of a few hours leave. One can imagine the jealousy the rest of the troops felt upon hearing of the band’s outing in Albany. 

</div>
		<div>HMNZT Tahiti carried 1,117 military personnel and 100 support staff on its journey from Wellington, New Zealand to Plymouth, England ­— nearly double the maximum capacity of roughly 650 persons the ship was originally designed to hold. 

While exceeding capacity was not uncommon for similar troopships at the time, the crowded conditions onboard the Tahiti would lead to devastating consequences before it reached its destination.

</div>
		<div>“Someday we’ll have freedom yet.”
This sonnet published in The Fag End brims with its author’s disappointed opinion of his time at Albany.
</div>
		<div>An experienced brass musician, Hansen was quick to join the military band onboard Tahiti. The group performed regular programs for the troops, participated in a variety of parades, and within a couple of months after departing Wellington, played at funeral processions.

</div>
		<div>Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather. 

The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.
</div>
		<div>One from Mrs. Smith filled with Aulsebrook choice afternoon tea biscuits. Two from Vera H. One filled with miscellaneous lollies chocolates etc and the other with a whole host of dainty articles, two magazines, one pot of cheddar cheese, one pot of fish paste, 1 box lollies, 1 box pastilles, 2 writing pads & envelopes and 1 tube toothpaste & lollies.

</div>
		<div>Some chaps had to get down to it and were  placed in the hospital upstairs, which is in a very comfortable position. 
</div>
		<div>The weather and sea was worse than ever & a good many of the boys are all as bad as ever again & some on deck are not able to come below & are lying about anywhere not caring whether they die or not & one or two have been taken in hand & placed in the hospital.
3/- per man today was given out for our canteen fund in canteen tickets and are very useful.
I had three parcels delivered to me today & was pleased & very much surprised with them.
</div>
		<div>Lieutenant D.C. Low:</div>
		<div>We awoke up with the bugle call at Reveille and found the weather had changed to a very rough sea & plenty of wind.
Most of the boys [now] were sickand were vomiting anywhereand everywhere, in the eatingutensils, on the floor, on the seatand tables and as no pans wereprovided,  the poor chaps  couldcould not help themselves but did their best to reach up the stairway to the deck, but in most cases could not get there in time. I was sick myself this day & felt very miserable.</div>
