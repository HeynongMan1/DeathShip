		<div>Tahiti carried 1,117 military personnel and 100 support staff on its journey from Wellington, NZ to Plymouth, UK., nearly double the maximum capacity of roughly 650 persons the ship was designed for. 

While exceeding capacity was not uncommon for similar troopships at the time, the crowded conditions onboard Tahiti would lead to devastating consequences before it reached its destination.

</div>
		<div>Monday, July 15:


As rough as ever and cold and waves mountain high. 

I had often heard the expression about waves being mountains high and can now say I have felt what they are like. When we struck these waves sideways on we would have our hammocks almost touch the roof & things would fall off the shelves with a crash & the seats would slide across the floor & the boat would shake & shiver and make one think the end is not far off. But we would find we are still afloat by the morning. 

I often think the skipper & his officers must have very trying time in this rough weather & yet they say it is nothing & that it is only rough when the waves are crashing over the bridge. We have managed a roll call twice a day so far.

</div>

		<div>An experienced brass musician, Hansen was quick to join the military band onboard Tahiti. The group performed regular programs for the troops, participated in a variety of parades and a couple of months after departing Wellington, played at funeral processions.
</div>
		<div>The next few days saw much calmer seas, with little of note apart from a few safety drills conducted on deck. Life aboard HMNZT Tahiti began to fall into regular routine, with a few challenges as noted by Hansen in his entries from July 16-18. Shaving and washing proved especially difficult due to the constant swells of the sea.

</div>
		<div>At times the waves would dash right over the bows of the ship & a lot of water would run down in to our den where we are living like rats.

</div>
		<div>The band continued to develop and accumulate members, with Hansen writing “The band is now making good progress and given fine weather we should be able to have a few open air practices on deck.”

</div>
		<div>Wednesday, July 10, 1918:
Embarked on the S.S. “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10am. We left the wharf at 1:55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well. 
There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1,200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7,000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks. 
Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather.
The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.</div>

		<div>The band continued to develop and accumulate members, with Hansen writing “The band is now making good progress and given fine weather we should be able to have a few open air practices on deck.”

Anticipation among the troops began to build for Tahiti’s first stop — Albany, Australia.

</div>
		<div>Most of the boys [now] were sick and were vomiting anywhere and everywhere, in the eating utensils, on the floor, on the seats and tables ...

</div>
		<div>The typical journey on a troopship from New Zealand to the Western Front took between six to 10 weeks. Lackluster days accumulated into long, monotonous weeks. To help cope with the boredom, magazines were produced and printed either onboard or at port to entertain soldiers with self-submitted observations, reflections, poetry, jokes and ship gossip. 

These magazines weren’t published until several weeks into the trip to allow for submissions to be collected and edited. Today the publications provide an invaluable perspective into the daily life on a troopship.

		<div>Private Alan Walter Brown's account of his first day atsea onboard Tahiti was published in HMNZT 107’s 
official magazine, The Fag End.</div>

		<div>Saturday, July 13:
The weather and sea was worse than ever & a good many of the boys are all as bad as ever again & some on deck are not able to come below & are lying about anywhere not caring whether they die or not & one or two have been taken in hand & placed in the hospital. 

3/- per man today was given out for our canteen fund in canteen tickets and are very useful. 

I had three parcels delivered to me today & was pleased & very much surprised with them. One from Mrs. Smith filled with Aulsebrook choice afternoon tea biscuits. Two from Vera H. One filled with  miscellaneous lollies chocolates etc and the other with a whole host of dainty articles, two magazines, one pot of cheddar cheese, one pot of fish paste, 1 box lollies, 1 box pastilles, 2 writing pads & envelopes and 1 tube toothpaste & lollies.
</div>
		<div>=</div>
		<div>The first few days at sea brought regular bouts of seasickness among those unused to the erratic swells and rocking of a vessel at sea. This would continue to recur for many soldiers upon leaving each port of call on Tahiti's journey.
</div>
		<div>Thursday, July 11:
We awoke up with the bugle call at Reveille and found the weather had changed to a very rough sea & plenty of wind. 

Most of the boys [now] were sick and were vomiting anywhere and everywhere, in the eating utensils, on the floor, on the seats and tables & as no pans were provided, the poor chaps could not help themselves but did their best to reach up the stairway to the deck, but in most cases could not get there in time. 

I was sick myself this day & felt very miserable. Some chaps had to get down to it and were placed in the hospital upstairs, which is in a very comfortable position.
 
At the WN port Dick Hamilton introduced me to Mr. Wicks O.C pantry & gave me & a cobber the option of taking on a job there in our spare time & have the privilege of dining there on saloon fare. Offer accepted but not yet availed of. About 20 of us got a [dunking] on the middle deck with a big wave.

		<div>Sunday, July 14:

Reveille as usual and weather windy & seas as rough, or rougher 
than ever. Everyone down in the dumps & some still sick. 

Today, we were all given a pad, envelopes and pencil, so this afternoon everyone is busy writing letters. I wrote two & found it extremely difficult to write owing to the pitching & tossing of the ship. At times the waves would dash right over the bows of the ship 
& a lot of water would run down in to our den where we are living like rats.

Our bunks, when we crawl into them, we look like caterpillars and as mine is right over a right of way to the stairs, the privacy of my bedroom is conspicuous by its absence. Water would run down & trickle in to my bed so got Bill C to move his one peg & so enabled me to move mine to a good position & am now ok.

		<div>Built in Scotland in 1904 as RMS Port Kingston, the 7.6-ton, two-masted screw steamer was subsequently purchased in 1911 by the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand and rechristened the SS Tahiti. The vessel then served as a passenger and cargo ship until it was called for service on the outbreak of WWI in 1914. 
SS Tahiti was then designated HMNZT (His Majesty’s New Zealand Troopship) Tahiti and joined a fleet of troopships to transport New Zealand Expeditionary Forces to and from the Western Front throughout WWI.

		<div>Lieut. David Collingwood Low:
</div>
		<div>"But shortly after that the epidemic struck New Zealand and of course the disaster in this country minimised the other one, and forgotten."
</div>
		<div>"Yes, well, this started just after we left Freetown. In all, I should think we must have had more than 1,000 cases of influenza on this ship, out of troops in complement probably of about 1,500."

</div>
		<div>New Zealand, 1967</div>
		<div>Unidentified male interviewer:
</div>
		<div>"There were questions asked in Parliament about the sickness on this ship. Why? Were the medical officers efficient? Were the stores sufficient? Were there sufficient drugs onboard?" 

</div>
		<div>"Now, during that voyage, Dr. Low, when you were assistant medical officer, you had an outbreak of influenza, a quite serious one. I wonder if you'd tell me the story?"
</div>
		<div>"Lieutenant D. C. Low, who was assistant medical officer on board the New Zealand transport, Tahiti. Tahiti left Wellington on the 10 of July, 1918."</div>
