Embarked on the S.S. “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10am.</div>
		<div>Infinite zoom with virus > clouds ? Ocean > ship</div>
		<div>Thursday, July 11:
We awoke up with the bugle call at Reveille and found the weather had changed to a very rough sea & plenty of wind. 

Most of the boys [now] were sick and were vomiting anywhere and everywhere, in the eating utensils, on the floor, on the seats and tables & as no pans were provided, the poor chaps could not help themselves but did their best to reach up the stairway to the deck, but in most cases could not get there in time. 

I was sick myself this day & felt very miserable. Some chaps had to get down to it and were placed in the hospital upstairs, which is in a very comfortable position.
 
At the WN port Dick Hamilton introduced me to Mr. Wicks O.C pantry & gave me & a cobber the option of taking on a job there in our spare time & have the privilege of dining there on saloon fare. Offer accepted but not yet availed of. About 20 of us got a [dunking] on the middle deck with a big wave.
</div>
		<div>Wednesday, July 10, 1918:
Embarked on the S.S. “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10am. We left the wharf at 1:55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well. 
There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1,200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7,000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks. 
Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather.
The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.</div>

Quick lil illo of HMNZT Tahiti</div>
		<div>An experienced brass musician, Hansen was quick to join the military band onboard Tahiti. The group performed regular programs for the troops, participated in a variety of parades and a couple of months after departing Wellington, played at funeral processions.

		<div>Built in Scotland in 1904 as RMS Port Kingston, the 7.6-ton, two-masted screw steamer was subsequently purchased in 1911 by the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand and rechristened the SS Tahiti. The vessel then served as a passenger and cargo ship until it was called for service on the outbreak of WWI in 1914. 
SS Tahiti was then designated HMNZT (His Majesty’s New Zealand Troopship) Tahiti and joined a fleet of troopships to transport New Zealand Expeditionary Forces to and from the Western Front throughout WWI.

		<div>Tahiti carried 1,117 military personnel and 100 support staff on its journey from Wellington, NZ to Plymouth, UK., nearly double the maximum capacity of roughly 650 persons the ship was designed for. 

While exceeding capacity was not uncommon for similar troopships at the time, the crowded conditions onboard Tahiti would lead to devastating consequences before it reached its destination.

</div>
		<div>Most of the boys [now] were sick and were vomiting anywhere and everywhere, in the eating utensils, on the floor, on the seats and tables ...

</div>
		<div>The first few days at sea brought regular bouts of seasickness among those unused to the erratic swells and rocking of a vessel at sea. This would continue to recur for many soldiers upon leaving each port of call on Tahiti's journey.
</div>
		<div>Lieut. David Collingwood Low:
</div>
		<div>"But shortly after that the epidemic struck New Zealand and of course the disaster in this country minimised the other one, and forgotten."
</div>
		<div>"Yes, well, this started just after we left Freetown. In all, I should think we must have had more than 1,000 cases of influenza on this ship, out of troops in complement probably of about 1,500."

</div>
		<div>New Zealand, 1967</div>
		<div>Unidentified male interviewer:
</div>
		<div>"There were questions asked in Parliament about the sickness on this ship. Why? Were the medical officers efficient? Were the stores sufficient? Were there sufficient drugs onboard?" 

</div>
		<div>"Now, during that voyage, Dr. Low, when you were assistant medical officer, you had an outbreak of influenza, a quite serious one. I wonder if you'd tell me the story?"
</div>
		<div>"Lieutenant D. C. Low, who was assistant medical officer on board the New Zealand transport, Tahiti. Tahiti left Wellington on the 10 of July, 1918."</div>
