Embarked on the S.S. “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10am. We left the wharf at 1:55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well. 

There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1,200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7,000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks. 

Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather.

The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.

</div>
		<div>"Yes, well, this started just after we left Freetown. In all, I should think we must have had more than 1,000 cases of influenza on this ship, out of troops in complement probably of about 1,500."

		<div>Unidentified male interviewer:
</div>
		<div>"There were questions asked in Parliament about the sickness on this ship. Why? Were the medical officers efficient? Were the stores sufficient? Were there sufficient drugs onboard?" 

</div>
		<div>"Now, during that voyage, Dr. Low, when you were assistant medical officer, you had an outbreak of influenza, a quite serious one. I wonder if you'd tell me the story?"
