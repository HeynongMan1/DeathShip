The worst outbreak experienced by a U.S. troopship happened on the SS Leviathan in early October 1918. By the time the vessel reached its destination, roughly 2,000 of the 11,000 troops and crew (18%), had been infected.
The outbreak on New Zealand transport SS Tahiti, however, saw far worse results. When the Tahiti arrived at Plymouth, U.K., on September 10, 1918,  more than 90% of its 1,217 passengers had been or still were infected. Combined with the 7% death rate, what happened on the Tahiti was likely the worst outbreak to occur onboard a troopship during the 1918 pandemic.

		<div>Few other firsthand accounts of the tragedy on the Tahiti have surfaced since its ill-fated voyage in the summer of 1918. In 2012, a soldier’s diary was located and transcribed by his grandson, who had discovered it while going through some of his late father’s possessions. 

The diarist, private Marcus Christian Hansen, was a member of the 40th Reinforcements, the New Zealand military unit onboard the troopship from July 10 through September 10, 1918. He was 31 years old at the time of the voyage.

Hansen’s diary delivers an unprecedented firsthand account of one the most devastating outbreaks of the 1918 pandemic — an outbreak so severe that the Tahiti became known as the “death ship.”
