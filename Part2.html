This ballad published in The Fag End sings of the hope and pride carried by the young men aboard the ship.</div>
		<div>MAP</div>
		<div>Another beautiful day & calm sea. Had a sudden shower of rain at 11am & lasted about half an hour. Weather very warm now. 

This morning I had an hour’s fatigue brass polishing & at 9am the band Sergt spoke to the Sergt Major about it with the result that I was relieved a little after 9am and was then able to attend band parade. We had two band parades as usual today & I suppose will very shortly be playing in Capetown now.

		<div>At 3 pm we went thru’ the GPO, took about 2 hours and then had tea, eggs and chips. In the evening went to the Tivoli Vaudeville, wasn’t bad, not as good as Fullers though. 

The town and surroundings are very nice. Town about as big as Wanganui. The mountains table lions head etc look very grim on first appearance. The railway station we also had a look at and is a very nice one very much like an arcade of shops. The wharves are very large also & we were berthed about two miles from town.
</div>
		<div>Last night we were steaming very slowly to arrive in Capetown harbour in the daylight which we did about 8 am. Leave was given all day till 11.30pm. Troops were marched into town headed by band, arriving there about midday. 

Had dinner at Maxims with Callery and Leeming. Good dinner, 5 courses. A lot of the troops patronised this place also. The weather was perfect like midsummer and is really their mid winter. Did some shopping, book of views, ostrich feathers and jackhol skins etc.
</div>
		<div>Sierra Leone. The paths of these ships were fated to cross before the end of the month.

Like the Tahiti, the Mantua had been an ocean liner before it was converted into a military cruiser in 1914. Like the Tahiti, the Mantua carried troops bound for the battlefield. However, in August 1918 the Mantua delivered more than just soldiers to Freetown.
Ship logs indicate that an influenza outbreak emerged onboard within two days of departing Plymouth. By the time the Mantua arrived in Freetown on August 15, over 200 of its crew were sick. When local workers boarded the ship to load coal, they brought the disease back with them to shore. In ten days, 500 of the 600 coal yard workers were too sick to come into work.
</div>
		<div>I saw the most beautiful sunset tonight that I have ever seen in my life. It was a real picture & I watched it for about an hour. It was really wonderful and seemed to change all the time into different colours etc. & one could see the sun drop into the horizon quite distinctly. 

Also lightening tonight after tea. Rumours now that Durban will be our next port of call.

</div>
		<div>Entry #27</div>
		<div>The virus surged throughout the colony. Businesses either closed or remained open with just a few essential workers. Travel was restricted and the town’s streets remained relatively empty while hundreds died each week. The deadly second wave of the 1918 ‘Spanish Flu’ had entered Africa.

While the virus raged in Freetown, the Tahiti remained steadfast in its course to Plymouth. Two more port-of-calls remained in the journey: Cape Town, South Africa, and as fate would have it, Freetown.

Private Marcus Hansen continued to write in his diary. His entries would unfortunately mark the final days of the first New Zealanders to die from the 1918 pandemic virus.

		<div>Only one practice with the band today, too rough this morning and of course could not use the Sergt’s mess room. This afternoon the sea is calmer but after tea it has started to come up rough again. 
Feeling a bit seedy today and still have a slight cold. Throat almost better now.
</div>
		<div>Last night and this morning I think is about the roughest wind and sea we have had so far. I woke at about midnight and could not sleep again owing to the noise and swinging about of the hammock.

We expect to be in Capetown in about a week and are all looking forward to seeing land again. It was a great sight to be on deck and to watch the waves washing up over the bows and it was a common thing to see the spray come right over the bridge.
