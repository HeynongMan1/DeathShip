No band today but we played a programme this evening instead. Was told that signals received from the Japanese steamer next to us said that they also enjoyed the music.

		<div>"Song of the Fortieths"
This ballad published in The Fag End sings of the hope and pride carried by the young men aboard the ship.</div>
		<div>Bill Callery discovered his brother was on board the other ship. 

[Locals] were loading coal all night & all day & water is still being pumped aboard. We hope to give a concert on the other ship tomorrow & I hope this will be done, as I would like a visit there.

</div>
		<div>Still in Freetown, weather warm and all well.
No leave allowed here as yellow fever is prevalent on shore. 

Fair amount of rain today and this morning we all had a bath in it on the well deck & it was just decent, the best wash for six weeks & we needed it too. No band parades today but we played a programme on the boat deck this evening. 

A boat came in this afternoon about tea time with returning NZ soldiers, & there is great excitement on board and signals were exchanged between the boys by flags & semaphore.

		<div>My health is still good with the exception of a couple of blisters on the roof of my mouth but not very bad. A few flying fish can still be seen alongside the ship but all very small ones.

Guard duty on the lookout for submarines etc is to be started tomorrow.
</div>
		<div>Weather still warm and sea smooth. The boat is changing its course every 10 minutes for some reason or other.

Held two band practices as usual and went through a couple of new pieces (cornet solo). The mail closes 9.30 tonight; posted two letters and one pc.
A mail will be posted at Freetown if there is a boat leaving there shortly, we expect to sight land shortly now, Thursday perhaps.

</div>
		<div>All day fresh water was pumped into the ship from water vessels tugged up to the side. [Locals] were parading about up to the side of the ship and were selling fruit, cocoa-nuts etc & soon were diving for coins thrown in the water.

The ship signalers started again today & have had to change quarters owing to shifts having to be worked out.
</div>
		<div>All roused at 4.30am for parade at 5am with life belts on. We entered Freetown at daybreak, weather hot & muggy & occasionally a shower of rain. The view coming in was very pretty and reminded me very much of NZ. Hills and any amount of trees, palms etc. by the look of them.

No leave granted to anyone today. Parades were washed out but we held our band parades as usual & this afternoon played a few selections on the boat deck. The port here is full of ships cargo, troops, etc, etc, & I hear we are to leave here on Sunday.

		<div>Sierra Leone. The paths of these ships were fated to cross before the end of the month.

Like the Tahiti, the Mantua had been an ocean liner before it was converted into a military cruiser in 1914. Like the Tahiti, the Mantua carried troops bound for the battlefield. However, in August 1918 the Mantua delivered more than just soldiers to Freetown.
Ship logs indicate that an influenza outbreak emerged onboard within two days of departing Plymouth. By the time the Mantua arrived in Freetown on August 15, over 200 of its crew were sick. When local workers boarded the ship to load coal, they brought the disease back with them to shore. In ten days, 500 of the 600 coal yard workers were too sick to come into work.
</div>
		<div>At 3 pm we went thru’ the GPO, took about 2 hours and then had tea, eggs and chips. In the evening went to the Tivoli Vaudeville, wasn’t bad, not as good as Fullers though. 

The town and surroundings are very nice. Town about as big as Wanganui. The mountains table lions head etc look very grim on first appearance. The railway station we also had a look at and is a very nice one very much like an arcade of shops. The wharves are very large also & we were berthed about two miles from town.
</div>
		<div>Monday, August 19</div>
		<div>The virus surged throughout the colony. Businesses either closed or remained open with just a few essential workers. Travel was restricted and the town’s streets remained relatively empty while hundreds died each week. The deadly second wave of the 1918 ‘Spanish Flu’ had entered Africa.

While the virus raged in Freetown, the Tahiti remained steadfast in its course to Plymouth. Two more port-of-calls remained in the journey: Cape Town, South Africa, and as fate would have it, Freetown.

Private Marcus Hansen continued to write in his diary. His entries would unfortunately mark the final days of the first New Zealanders to die from the 1918 pandemic virus.
</div>
		<div>Last night we were steaming very slowly to arrive in Capetown harbour in the daylight which we did about 8 am. Leave was given all day till 11.30pm. Troops were marched into town headed by band, arriving there about midday. 

Had dinner at Maxims with Callery and Leeming. Good dinner, 5 courses. A lot of the troops patronised this place also. The weather was perfect like midsummer and is really their mid winter. Did some shopping, book of views, ostrich feathers and jackhol skins etc.

		<div>A stricken ship</div>
		<div>Left Capetown at 8.40am, weather still fine but ship rolling a lot, later on rolling not so bad. All feeling very tired and sleepy as the last two nights we have had about 5 hours sleep. I was on fatigue this morning from 6am till about 10am with a dozen others scrubbing decks after the coaling. 

No band today, everybody too tired and down in the dumps at leaving land again. Our stay at Capetown was very enjoyable and all had a good time there.There are some very nice houses and buildings very much like the same as NZ and the bungalow style of house seems to get a good hearing. </div>

		<div>Orders today to parade at 9am with life belts on as we are to make a start again. Weather fine & hot, sea smooth and we have left about 9.30am. All told the convoy consists of 10 ships and the escort auxiliary cruiser which is a [P10] boat two funneller & a very nice looking steamer. 

There is one passenger boat, ourselves & the rest are cargo boats, we are only to travel about 10 knots an hour. All port holes have been painted black & all have been warned in regard to lights being shown on deck.

		<div>The deadly second wave of the influenza pandemic is in its early stages, aided by troop movements throughout the globe. Three weeks into its voyage, the Tahiti remains on course to Plymouth. Two more port of calls remain in the journey. One of them — Freetown, Sierra Leone — will be teeming with the virus by the time the Tahiti arrives. Private Hansen writes in his diary, marking the last days of many onboard the ship.

		<div>AUGUST 1, 1918:</div>

</div>
		<div>Still in Freetown and all provisions etc now on board, after the first day [locals] were not allowed near the boat with their fruit etc & were kept off with a revolver shot or two from the skipper or an officer.

The weather is very hot & a shower occasionally. The water was also a bit rough. 

All the time we have been here there has been about twenty odd ships anchored in the harbour,
</div>
		<div>Note about Table Mountain and Lion’s Head, two prominent landforms on the coast of Capetown. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut Ut wisi enimn ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut

		<div>N AUGUST 1, 1918, while the Tahiti continued its voyage to Plymouth, another troopship, the HMS Mantua, departed Plymouth for Freetown,</div>
		<div>Another beautiful day & calm sea. Had a sudden shower of rain at 11am & lasted about half an hour. Weather very warm now. 

This morning I had an hour’s fatigue brass polishing & at 9am the band Sergt spoke to the Sergt Major about it with the result that I was relieved a little after 9am and was then able to attend band parade. We had two band parades as usual today & I suppose will very shortly be playing in Capetown now. 
</div>
		<div>At 3 pm we went thru’ the GPO, took about 2 hours and then had tea, eggs and chips. In the evening went to the Tivoli Vaudeville, wasn’t bad, not as good as Fullers though.

		<div>Entry #46</div>
		<div>Only one practice with the band today, too rough this morning and of course could not use the Sergt’s mess room. This afternoon the sea is calmer but after tea it has started to come up rough again. 
Feeling a bit seedy today and still have a slight cold. Throat almost better now.
</div>
		<div>Last night we were steaming very slowly to arrive in Capetown harbour in the daylight which we did about 8 am. Leave was given all day till 11.30pm. Troops were marched into town headed by band, arriving there about midday.

</div>
		<div>Last night and this morning I think is about the roughest wind and sea we have had so far. I woke at about midnight and could not sleep again owing to the noise and swinging about of the hammock.

We expect to be in Capetown in about a week and are all looking forward to seeing land again. It was a great sight to be on deck and to watch the waves washing up over the bows and it was a common thing to see the spray come right over the bridge.

		<div>The pier is really beautiful and is an ideal place for concerts etc and the view from the town which did at night, was just beautiful. It is a good long walk all around the whole pier and one can get refreshments there also. People were also fishing there.

</div>
		<div>Read “The Epic of the 40th,” a poem written  shortly after the ship’s previous stop at Albany.</div>
		<div>Monday, August 5</div>
		<div>I saw the most beautiful sunset tonight that I have ever seen in my life. It was a real picture & I watched it for about an hour. It was really wonderful and seemed to change all the time into different colours etc. & one could see the sun drop into the horizon quite distinctly. 

Also lightening tonight after tea. Rumours now that Durban will be our next port of call.

</div>
		<div>Sunday, August 25</div>
		<div>It was a grand sight to see us steaming out of the harbour one behind the other and we had the band out on the boat deck to celebrate the occasion.
 
We are now travelling in two lines of 5 and the war ship in the lead. She shows two lights and the others one as far as I can see. 

The hospital is over full and also a dozen patients on deck.
